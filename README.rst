Shadow of the Blitz v 0.2.0
===========================

Shadow of the Blitz has been rewritten using SDL.
It's as simple as it was, and I've only done it to see how SDL handle some parallax scrolls. I'm a bit disappointed, as it's fast, but not smooth at all. And I don't think I can fix it until I can set/get the resolution frequency using SDL =(
